# 🚗 My Ford Benefits Portal

## Description

The **My Ford Benefits Portal** is a mock, user-friendly, single-page application (SPA) designed to simulate the experience of exploring and managing employee and partner recognition programs, such as the widely known A/X/Z Plans, as well as core employee benefits like health and retirement. This platform aims to provide Ford personnel and eligible partners with clear, concise, and centralized access to their valuable perks and programs. The application structure, built on React, is a template for creating a high-performance, responsive interface capable of handling complex data, such as eligibility criteria, discount tiers, and detailed plan summaries. The goal is to demystify the benefits structure, allowing users to quickly check their eligibility, view savings, and initiate enrollment or PIN generation processes.
